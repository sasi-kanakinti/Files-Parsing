=== Learning roadmap for AI_ML.pdf (.pdf) ===
Learning roadmap for AI/ML
• Languages & Frameworks: Python, LangChain, HuggingFace
• AI/ML Technologies: RAG, Prompt Engineering, Generative AI
• Cloud & Tools: Azure AI Services, Azure OpenAI, Databricks, Git, DBeaver
• Data Processing: PDF/Word/Excel parsing, ETL pipelines
with in these which one should i start learning with give me a roadmap to complete all the 
things
Got it 👍 Before I sketch out a roadmap, let me quickly check in:
Are you aiming to learn these for career growth (like AI/ML engineer, data engineer, cloud
developer), or for projects/personal learning?
That will help me fine-tune how deep we go into each.
For now, I’ll assume you’re looking at career-ready learning in AI/ML with practical projects. Here’s a
step-by-step roadmap to cover everything you listed:
🚀 Roadmap (Beginner → Advanced)
Step 1: Core Programming & Data Handling
Python → Foundation. Master syntax, OOP, data structures, libraries (NumPy, Pandas).
Data Processing → Learn how to parse PDF/Word/Excel (e.g., PyPDF, docx, openpyxl) and build
small ETL pipelines.
👉 Mini Project: Extract text from PDFs, clean it, and save to a database.
Step 2: AI/ML Fundamentals
ML Basics → Scikit-learn (classification, regression, clustering).
Generative AI Concepts → Understand LLMs, embeddings, tokenization.
Prompt Engineering → Practice crafting prompts for ChatGPT & open-source LLMs.
Step 3: Frameworks & Libraries
LangChain → Learn chaining, memory, tools, agents.
HuggingFace → Explore pre-trained models, transformers, and fine-tuning.
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) → Combine embeddings + vector DBs (e.g., FAISS,
Chroma).
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API.
1/6
👉 Mini Project: Build a Q&A chatbot over your PDF collection.
Step 4: Cloud & Tools
Azure AI Services & Azure OpenAI → Learn deploying LLMs, integrating cognitive search.
Databricks → Learn scalable data processing, ML pipelines.
Git & DBeaver → Version control & database management.
👉 Mini Project: Deploy your RAG chatbot on Azure, connect it to a database, and manage with
Git.
Step 5: Integration & Advanced Projects
End-to-end AI application:
ETL pipeline to collect data
Use LangChain + HuggingFace for RAG
Deploy on Azure with Databricks pipelines
Manage codebase with Git
⏳ Suggested Timeline
Month 1–2: Python + Data Processing
Month 3: ML basics + Prompt Engineering
Month 4–5: LangChain + HuggingFace + RAG
Month 6–7: Azure + Databricks + Deployment
Month 8+: Build full-stack AI projects
💡 Question for you:
Do you prefer a project-based roadmap (learn by building small apps each step) or a theory-first
roadmap (cover concepts deeply, then projects)?
I'm planning to learn these for my career growth in AI Engineer - Generative AI Solutions
Perfect — that makes it clear!
If your goal is AI Engineer (Generative AI Solutions), then the roadmap should be project-driven,
because employers care about seeing end-to-end solutions you can build, not just theory.
Here’s how I’d structure it for you:
🎯 Career Roadmap for AI Engineer – Generative AI Solutions

3/6
🔑 Key Learning Strategy
1. Always tie learning to projects → theory alone won’t stick.
2. Publish your work → GitHub + LinkedIn portfolio.
3. Focus on RAG + Azure deployment → hot skills right now for AI Engineers.
Now, to make this roadmap concrete:
Do you want me to design your first 2 projects (step-by-step tasks + resources) so you can start
building while learning Python & data processing?
I want to complete it in like about 2 months period. and i'm well versed in java so i'm sure i can 
manage python as well and i know how to use git 
That’s great — since you already know Java and Git, you can compress the timeline. Instead of 8
months, we can make a focused 2-month (8-week) roadmap with projects baked in.
Here’s how you can do it:
⚡ 2-Month Roadmap for Generative AI Engineer
Week 1: Python for AI + Data Processing
Brush up only the Python bits you don’t know → list/dict comprehensions, decorators, async,
NumPy, Pandas.
Learn to parse PDFs/Word/Excel.
Mini Project: Extract text from PDFs → clean → load into SQLite/DB (using DBeaver for queries).
Week 2: Prompt Engineering + Generative AI Basics
Study prompting techniques: zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role prompting.
Explore OpenAI API and HuggingFace Transformers at a basic level.
Mini Project: Build a small chatbot using OpenAI API with prompt templates.
Week 3–4: RAG + LangChain + HuggingFace
Deep dive into LangChain: chains, tools, memory, agents.
HuggingFace: embeddings, using models locally (LLaMA, Falcon, Mistral).
RAG: combine embeddings + vector DB (FAISS/Chroma).
Mini Project: Q&A chatbot over PDFs (retrieves answers from docs).
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API.
4/6
Week 5: Azure AI & Databricks
Learn Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Search, and vector search.
Get familiar with Databricks → simple ETL pipelines, ML model training.
Mini Project: Deploy your RAG chatbot on Azure (serve via REST API).
Week 6: Integration + Deployment
Dockerize your chatbot.
Learn CI/CD basics (GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps).
Mini Project: End-to-end deployment of your chatbot with a web UI (Streamlit/Flask + Azure).
Week 7–8: Capstone Projects (Portfolio-Ready)
Choose 2 projects to polish and showcase:
1. Enterprise Document Assistant → upload docs (PDF/Excel/Word), ask questions, get answers.
2. Generative Insights API → an API that summarizes, extracts insights, and answers queries from
business data.
👉 Push to GitHub + write short LinkedIn posts about what you learned → this is gold for recruiters.
⏳ Study Rhythm (per week)
15–20 hrs total → 2 hrs on weekdays, 5 hrs on weekends.
Balance: 40% coding projects, 40% reading/docs, 20% videos/tutorials.
⚠️ Key advantage: Since you know Java + Git, you can skip a lot of basics and dive directly into
LangChain, HuggingFace, and Azure deployment — those are the skills employers want to see.
Do you want me to draft a detailed weekly learning plan (resources + project outline for each
week) so you know exactly what to study and build each step of the way?
yeah give me a weekly planning and make it into a pdf for me to download both roadmap and 
weekly planning
Here’s your 2-Month Generative AI Engineer Roadmap & Weekly Plan in PDF format:

Do you want me to also add a list of resources (docs, tutorials, GitHub repos) for each week inside the
PDF, so you don’t have to hunt them down separately?
